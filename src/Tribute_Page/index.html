        <p><b>William Henry Gates</b> III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business magnate, investor, author,
            philanthropist, and humanitarian. He is best known as the principal founder of Microsoft Corporation. During
            his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect, while also
            being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, Gates launched Microsoft with Paul Allen in 1975; it went on to
            become the world's largest personal computer software company. Gates led the company as chairman and CEO
            until stepping down as CEO in January 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect.In
            June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at Microsoft and full-time
            work at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, Melinda
            Gates, established in 2000. He gradually transferred his duties to Ray Ozzie and Craig Mundie. He stepped
            down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the
            newly appointed CEO Satya Nadella.</p>
